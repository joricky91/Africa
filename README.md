# Africa 

This is the fifth app created as a part of SwiftUI + SwiftData Masterclass - iOS App Development Swift course projects. There are many new things that I learned in this project: 
- MapKit framework
- AVFoundation and video player
- Complex SwiftUI grid layout

Thank you so much for Robert Petras for this project and teachings!
